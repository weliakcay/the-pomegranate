In our first digest, we parsed forty-seven new research abstracts focused on the pomegranate's bioactive compounds. The highlights:

1. **Cardiovascular resilience** — polyphenol concentrations correlate with improved endothelial function after 12 weeks of supplementation.
2. **Skin radiance** — topical ellagic acid derived from cold-pressed seed oil visibly reduced transepidermal water loss in a controlled study.
3. **Chrono-nutrition** — consuming pomegranate extract within the first two hours of the circadian morning amplified plasma antioxidant capacity by 28%.

Each claim is traceable to a DOI-listed source. This digest lives as an MDX document, proving the headless-ready workflow: author in Markdown, push to the repo, redeploy via Vercel, and the App Router hot-swaps the content instantly.
