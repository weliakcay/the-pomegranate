Welcome to **The Pomegranate** â€” a digital orchard where every seed reveals a universe. The experience is anchored by a cinematic 3D hero with camera choreography inspired by Apple product reveals. Scroll gently and the scene whispers forward: the shell glides open, arils shimmer, and science stories pin in place.

What to expect:

- **Science**: peer-reviewed MDX entries that map antioxidants to real-world outcomes.
- **Art**: a curated gallery across AI renderings, pristine photography, and 3D explorations.
- **Journal**: design logs, research roundups, and launch notes like this one.

The project is production-grade, yet intentionally headless-ready. Swap in your own content pipeline, tighten the assets, and the soul of The Pomegranate remains: a respectful ode to time, craft, and curiosity.
