The first gesture of _The Pomegranate_ was restraint. Pure white canvas, disciplined grids, and high-contrast typography mirror the minimalist reverence of Apple product launches. We built the layout with a twelve-column rhythm and preserved generous breathing room to allow the hero 3D object to become the focus.

The color language leans on a pomegranate's deep nar red—`#8B0014`—paired with muted charcoal inks. Gradients are rare and deployed only when the narrative demands a sense of depth; consider them the shimmer of light across a polished shell.

Motion follows the same philosophy. We use Lenis for buttery traversal, GSAP ScrollTrigger for scene choreography, and Framer Motion for responsive micro-interactions. Each timeline runs in its own scope, easing out before the next experience begins, preventing scroll fatigue.

Motherboard-level detail extends into accessibility: every motion sequence checks `prefers-reduced-motion`, alt texts articulate visual meaning, and focus states are bold enough for keyboard explorers. Luxury is never at odds with inclusivity.
