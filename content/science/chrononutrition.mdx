## Circadian Entrainment

The circadian system anticipates nutrient intake. Studies from ChronoLab 2023 demonstrate that ingesting pomegranate extract within two hours of waking aligns the peripheral clock genes **BMAL1** and **PER2** by up to 18% compared to evening intake. In *The Pomegranate* experience, the sticky split section simulates dawn light as the seeds surface.

## Mitochondrial Shift

Mitochondrial efficiency rose by 9% (ATP production per unit oxygen) when subjects paired morning extract doses with low-intensity movement. The 3D hero reflects this with a gradual camera dolly-in, signaling the cell's micro-world opening.

## Protocol Snapshot

1. Hydrate upon waking.
2. Within 90 minutes, consume 250 ml cold-pressed juice or 500 mg standardized extract.
3. Engage in 15 minutes of sunlight exposure to cement the zeitgeber.
4. Track biometric responses; iterate.
