## Barrier Function

Clinical double-blinds indicate that topical ellagic acid derived from pomegranate peel improved transepidermal water loss (TEWL) by 27% after four weeks compared to placebo. The experience mirrors this data: scrolling down the science section reveals cards with translucent shadows, echoing supple skin barriers.

In vitro assays show increased procollagen type I expression by 16% when fibroblasts are exposed to pomegranate tannins. This forms the backbone of the "Every seed, a universe" manifesto line — collagen scaffolds and mythic symbolism blend.

Pair cold-pressed seed oil with stabilized vitamin C for a synergistic dermal defense serum. Always patch test and consult dermatologists before full application.
