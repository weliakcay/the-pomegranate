## Vascular Tone and Flow-Mediated Dilation

Twelve-week randomized trials show that daily 500 mg punicalagin extract increased brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) by 12.5% in participants with elevated LDL. The mechanism links to the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improved nitric oxide bioavailability.

We visualized this by locking the hero 3D camera on the pomegranate core. As scroll progresses, GSAP eases the seeds outward while the text pins beside them, mirroring the dilation narrative.

## Lipid Turnover Modulation

Supplementation lowered oxidized LDL by 19% and reduced serum triglycerides by 8% when paired with moderate aerobic exercise. These numbers inform the MetricGrid on the home page, reinforcing the tangible outcomes.

## Clinical Outlook

More longitudinal data is needed, but early indicators suggest stacking pomegranate polyphenols with statins could amplify protective benefits. Always consult healthcare professionals before altering prescribed regimes.
